  abstract = {In a recent paper, Lo et al. (2001) propose a test for the likelihood ratio statistic based on the Kullback-Leibler information criterion when testing the null hypothesis that a random sample is drawn from a mixture of \$k\_\{0\}\$ normal components against the alternative hypothesis of a mixture with \$k\_\{1\}\$ normal components with \$k\_\{0\}\$ less than \$k\_\{1\}\$. However, this result requires conditions that are generally not met when the null hypothesis holds. Consequently, the result is not proven and simulations suggest that it may not be correct.},
