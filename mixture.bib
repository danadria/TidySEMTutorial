	abstract = {The latent class model is a powerful unsupervised clustering algorithm for categorical data. Many statistics exist to test the ﬁt of the latent class model. However, traditional methods to evaluate those ﬁt statistics are not always useful. Asymptotic distributions are not always known, and empirical reference distributions can be very time consuming to obtain. In this paper we propose a fast resampling scheme with which any type of model ﬁt can be assessed. We illustrate it here on the latent class model, but the methodology can be applied in any situation. The principle behind the lazy bootstrap method is to specify a statistic which captures the characteristics of the data that a model should capture correctly. If those characteristics in the observed data and in model-generated data are very diﬀerent we can assume that the model could not have produced the observed data. With this method we achieve the ﬂexibility of tests from the Bayesian framework, while only needing maximum likelihood estimates. We provide a step-wise algorithm with which the ﬁt of a model can be assessed based on the characteristics we as researcher ﬁnd important. In a Monte Carlo study we show that the method has very low type I errors, for all illustrated statistics. Power to reject a model depended largely on the type of statistic that was used and on sample size. We applied the method to an empirical data set on clinical subgroups with risk of Myocardial infarction and compared the results directly to the parametric bootstrap. The results of our method were highly similar to those obtained by the parametric bootstrap, while the required computations diﬀered three orders of magnitude in favour of our method.},

Model selection is one of the most important problems in mixture cluster analysis based on the mixture of multivariate normal distributions. Model selection involves the determination of the number of components (clusters) and the selection of an appropriate covariance structure in the mixture cluster analysis. In this study, the efficiency of information criteria that are commonly used in model selection is examined. The effectiveness of information criteria has been determined according to the success in the selection of the number of components and in the selection of an appropriate covariance matrix.},

	abstract = {This article compares two missing data procedures, full information maximum likelihood (FIML) and multiple imputation (MI), to investigate their relative performances in relation to the results from analyses of the original complete data or the hypothetical data available before missingness occurred. By expressing the FIML estimator as a special MI estimator, we predicted the expected patterns of discrepancy between the two estimators. Via Monte Carlo simulation studies where we have access to the original complete data, we compare the performance of FIML and MI estimators to that of the complete data maximum likelihood (ML) estimator under a wide range of conditions, including differences in sample size, percent of missingness, and degrees of model misfit. Our study confirmed well-known knowledge that the two estimators tend to yield essentially equivalent results to each other and to those from analysis of complete data when the postulated model is correctly specified. However, some noteworthy patterns of discrepancies were found between the FIML and MI estimators when the hypothesized model does not hold exactly in the population: MI-based parameter estimates, comparative fit index (CFI), and the Tucker Lewis index (TLI) tend to be closer to the counterparts of the complete data ML estimates, whereas FIML-based chi-squares and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) tend to be closer to the counterparts of the complete data ML estimates. We explained the observed patterns of discrepancy between the two estimators as a function of the interplay between the parsimony and accuracy of the imputation model. We concluded by discussing practical and methodological implications and issues for further research. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {Reviewers of research reports frequently criticize the choice of statistical methods. While some of these criticisms are well-founded, frequently the use of various parametric methods such as analysis of variance, regression, correlation are faulted because: (a) the sample size is too small, (b) the data may not be normally distributed, or (c) The data are from Likert scales, which are ordinal, so parametric statistics cannot be used. In this paper, I dissect these arguments, and show that many studies, dating back to the 1930s consistently show that parametric statistics are robust with respect to violations of these assumptions. Hence, challenges like those above are unfounded, and parametric methods can be utilized without concern for “getting the wrong answer”.},

They derived rather strong conclusions on the basis of this study, especially with regard to the good performance of K-means (KM) compared with MMC. I agree with the authors’ conclusion that the performance of KM may be equal to MMC in certain situations, which are primarily the situations investigated by Steinley and Brusco. However, a weakness of the paper is the failure to investigate many important real-world situations where theory suggests that MMC should outperform KM. This article elaborates on the KM–MMC comparison in terms of cluster recovery and provides some additional simulation results that show that KM may be much worse than MMC. Moreover, I show that KM is equivalent to a restricted mixture model estimated by maximizing the classiﬁcation likelihood and comment on Steinley and Brusco’s recommendation regarding the use of mixture models for clustering.},

	abstract = {Simple methods to choose sensible starting values for the EM algorithm to get maximum likelihood parameter estimation in mixture models are compared. They are based on random initialization, using a classification EM algorithm (CEM), a Stochastic EM algorithm (SEM) or previous short runs of EM itself. Those initializations are included in a search/run/select strategy which can be compounded by repeating the three steps. They are compared in the context of multivariate Gaussian mixtures on the basis of numerical experiments on both simulated and real data sets in a target number of iterations. The main conclusions of those numerical experiments are the following. The simple random initialization which is probably the most employed way of initiating EM is often outperformed by strategies using CEM, SEM or shorts runs of EM before running EM. Also, it appears that compounding is generally profitable since using a single run of EM can often lead to suboptimal solutions. Otherwise, none of the experimental strategies can be regarded as the best one and it is difficult to characterize situations where a particular strategy can be expected to outperform the other ones. However, the strategy initiating EM with short runs of EM can be recommended. This strategy, which as far as we know was not used before the present study, has some advantages. It is simple, performs well in a lot of situations presupposing no particular form of the mixture to be fitted to the data and seems little sensitive to noisy data.},

This mixture model included a severely affected group (7\%) with a comparatively moderate to high probability (0.32−0.88) of endorsing all abuse and dependence criteria items, and a less severely affected group (93\%) with a low probability (0.003−0.16) of endorsing all criteria. The two empirically defined groups differed significantly in the pattern of non-prescribed opioid use, co-morbid major depression, and substance abuse treatment use.ConclusionsA factor mixture model integrating categorical and dimensional features of classification fits better to DSM-IV criteria for prescription opioid abuse and dependence in adults than a categorical or dimensional approach. Research is needed to examine the utility of this mixture classification for substance use disorders and treatment response.},

In a recent study of 5409 serum samples from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), a finite mixture model was developed to examine the distribution of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody levels against pertussis toxin (PT), an antigen specific to the Bordetella pertussis bacterium. The mixture model identified three component populations with antibody levels greater than the quantitative assay's lower limit of quantitation (LLQ) and included a point distribution located at or below the LLQ to account for the excess number of antibody values that fell below the LLQ. The mixture model analysis accounted for the NHANES III design. A cut-off point for anti-PT IgG levels was chosen to have a 99 per cent model specificity based on the two overlapping normal distributions assumed for the two component populations with the highest antibody levels. This cut-off point may have a higher diagnostic sensitivity for acute B. pertussis infection than other cut-off points derived by assuming a single distribution for antibody levels.

The adjective ªunsupervisedº is justified by two properties of the algorithm: 1) it is capable of selecting the number of components and 2) unlike the standard expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, it does not require careful initialization. The proposed method also avoids another drawback of EM for mixture fitting: the possibility of convergence toward a singular estimate at the boundary of the parameter space. The novelty of our approach is that we do not use a model selection criterion to choose one among a set of preestimated candidate models; instead, we seamlessly integrate estimation and model selection in a single algorithm. Our technique can be applied to any type of parametric mixture model for which it is possible to write an EM algorithm; in this paper, we illustrate it with experiments involving Gaussian mixtures.

Despite mixture models' usefulness in practice, one unresolved issue in the application of mixture models is that there is not one commonly accepted statistical indicator for deciding on the number of classes in a study population. This article presents the results of a simulation study that examines the performance of likelihood-based tests and the traditionally used Information Criterion (ICs) used for determining the number of classes in mixture modeling. We look at the performance of these tests and indexes for 3 types of mixture models: latent class analysis (LCA), a factor mixture model (FMA), and a growth mixture models (GMM). We evaluate the ability of the tests and indexes to correctly identify the number of classes at three different sample sizes (n = 200, 500, 1,000). Whereas the Bayesian Information Criterion performed the best of the ICs, the bootstrap likelihood ratio test proved to be a very consistent indicator of classes across all of the models considered.},

In this article, we provide answers to 10 frequently asked questions about LCA. The questions included in this article were fielded from our experience consulting with applied researchers interested in using LCA. The major topics include a general introduction in the LCA; an overview of class enumeration (e.g., deciding on the number of classes), including commonly used statistical fit indices; substantive interpretation of LCA solutions; estimation of covariates and distal outcome relations to the latent class variable; data requirements for LCA; software choices and considerations; distinctions and similarities among LCA and related latent variable models; and extensions of the LCA model. To illustrate the modeling ideas described in this article, we present an applied example using LCA. Specifically, we use LCA to model individual differences in positive youth development among college students and analyze demographic characteristics as covariates and a distal outcome of overall life satisfaction. We also include key references that direct readers to more detailed and technical discussions of these topics for which we provide an applied and introductory overview. We conclude by mentioning future developments in research and practice, including advanced cross-sectional and longitudinal extensions of LCA.},

	abstract = {A common concern when faced with multivariate data with missing values is whether the missing data are missing completely at random (MCAR); that is, whether missingness depends on the variables in the data set. One way of assessing this is to compare the means of recorded values of each variable between groups defined by whether other variables in the data set are missing or not. Although informative, this procedure yields potentially many correlated statistics for testing MCAR, resulting in multiple-comparison problems. This article proposes a single global test statistic for MCAR that uses all of the available data. The asymptotic null distribution is given, and the small-sample null distribution is derived for multivariate normal data with a monotone pattern of missing data. The test reduces to a standard t test when the data are bivariate with missing data confined to a single variable. A limited simulation study of empirical sizes for the test applied to normal and nonnormal data suggests that the test is conservative for small samples.},

	abstract = {Test of homogeneity of covariances (or homoscedasticity) among several groups has many applications in statistical analysis. In the context of incomplete data analysis, tests of homoscedasticity among groups of cases with identical missing data patterns have been proposed to test whether data are missing completely at random (MCAR). These tests of MCAR require large sample sizes n and/or large group sample sizes ni, and they usually fail when applied to nonnormal data. Hawkins (Technometrics 23:105–110, 1981) proposed a test of multivariate normality and homoscedasticity that is an exact test for complete data when ni are small. This paper proposes a modification of this test for complete data to improve its performance, and extends its application to test of homoscedasticity and MCAR when data are multivariate normal and incomplete. Moreover, it is shown that the statistic used in the Hawkins test in conjunction with a nonparametric k-sample test can be used to obtain a nonparametric test of homoscedasticity that works well for both normal and nonnormal data. It is explained how a combination of the proposed normal-theory Hawkins test and the nonparametric test can be employed to test for homoscedasticity, MCAR, and multivariate normality. Simulation studies show that the newly proposed tests generally outperform their existing competitors in terms of Type I error rejection rates. Also, a power study of the proposed tests indicates good power. The proposed methods use appropriate missing data imputations to impute missing data. Methods of multiple imputation are described and one of the methods is employed to confirm the result of our single imputation methods. Examples are provided where multiple imputation enables one to identify a group or groups whose covariance matrices differ from the majority of other groups.},

	abstract = {Background: Latent class analysis (LCA) can be used to identify subgroups of children with similar patterns of mental health symptoms and/or strengths. The method is becoming more commonly used in child mental health research, but there are reservations about the replicability, reliability, and validity of findings.Objective: A systematic literature review was conducted to investigate the extent to which LCA has been used to study population mental health in children, and whether replicable, reliable and valid findings have been demonstrated.Methods: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. A search of literature, published between January 1998 and December 2017, was carried out using MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycInfo, Scopus, ERIC, ASSIA, and Google Scholar. A total of 2,748 studies were initially identified, of which 23 were eligible for review. The review examined the methods which studies had used to choose the number of mental health classes, the classes that they found, and whether there was evidence for the validity and reliability of the classes.Results: Reviewed studies used LCA to investigate both disparate mental health symptoms, and those associated with specific disorders. The corpus of studies using similar indicators was small. Differences in the criteria used to select the final LCA model were found between studies. All studies found meaningful or useful subgroups, but there were differences in the extent to which the validity and reliability of classes were explicitly demonstrated.Conclusions : LCA is a useful tool for studying and classifying child mental health at the population level. Recommendations are made to improve the application and reporting of LCA and to increase confidence in findings in the future, including use of a range of indices and criteria when enumerating classes, clear reporting of methods for replicability, and making efforts to establish the validity and reliability of identified classes.},

Maximum likelihood (ML) estimates may behave poorly over repeated samples, and the abnormal shape of the likelihood often makes it difficult to assess the uncertainty in parameter estimates. Bayesian inference via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) can be a useful alternative to ML, but the component labels may switch during the MCMC run, making the output difficult to interpret. Two basic methods for handling the label-switching problem have been proposed: imposing constraints on the parameter space and cluster-based relabeling of the simulated parameters. We have found that label switching may also be reduced by supplying small amounts of prior information that are asymmetric with respect to the mixture components. Simply assigning one observation to each component a priori may effectively eliminate the problem. Using a very simple example—a univariate sample from a mixture of two exponentials—we evaluate the performance of likelihood and MCMC-based estimates and intervals over repeated sampling. Our simulations show that MCMC performs much better than ML if the label-switching problem is adequately addressed, and that asymmetric prior information performs as well as or better than the other proposed methods.},

Within this article, we (a) review the existing applications of LPA within past vocational behavior research; (b) illustrate best practice procedures in a non-technical way of how to use LPA methodology, with an illustrative example of identifying different latent profiles of heavy work investment (i.e., working compulsively, working excessively, and work engagement); and (c) outline future research possibilities in vocational behavior research. By reviewing 46 studies stemming from central journals of the field, we identified seven distinct topics that have already been investigated by LPA (e.g., job and organizational attitudes and behaviors, work motivation, career-related attitudes and orientations, vocational interests). Together with showing descriptive statistics about how LPA has been conducted in past vocational behavior research, we illustrate and derive best-practice recommendations for future LPA research. The review and “how to” guide can be helpful for all researchers interested in conducting LPA studies.},

A 4-class model of risk profiles fit the data best: (1) solitary users reported polydrug use at the individual level, but low probabilities of substance use or concurrent sexual partners with network members; (2) social–all-substance users reported polydrug use at the individual and network levels; (3) social–noninjection drug users reported less likelihood of injection drug and solvent use; (4) low-risk users reported low probabilities across substances. Unstable housing, preadolescent substance use, age, and hepatitis C status predicted risk profiles., Conclusions. Incorporation of social network variables into LCA can distinguish important subgroups with varying patterns of risk behaviors that can lead to sexually transmitted and bloodborne infections.},

	abstract = {In maximum likelihood estimation of latent class models, it often occurs that one or more of the parameter estimates are on the boundary of the parameter space; that is, that estimated probabilities equal 0 (or 1) or, equivalently, that logit coefficients equal minus (or plus) infinity. This not only causes numerical problems in the computation of the variance-covariance matrix, it also makes the reported confidence intervals and significance tests for the parameters concerned meaningless. Boundary estimates can, however, easily be prevented by the use of prior distributions for the model parameters, yielding a Bayesian procedure called posterior mode or maximum a posteriori estimation. This approach is implemented in, for example, the Latent GOLD software packages for latent class analysis (Vermunt \& Magidson, 2005). Little is, however, known about the quality of posterior mode estimates of the parameters of latent class models, nor about their sensitivity for the choice of the prior distribution. In this paper, we compare the quality of various types of posterior mode point and interval estimates for the parameters of latent class models with both the classical maximum likelihood estimates and the bootstrap estimates proposed by De Menezes (1999). Our simulation study shows that parameter estimates and standard errors obtained by the Bayesian approach are more reliable than the corresponding parameter estimates and standard errors obtained by maximum likelihood and parametric bootstrapping.},

	abstract = {Researchers using latent class (LC) analysis often proceed using the following three steps: (1) an LC model is built for a set of response variables, (2) subjects are assigned to LCs based on their posterior class membership probabilities, and (3) the association between the assigned class membership and external variables is investigated using simple cross-tabulations or multinomial logistic regression analysis. Bolck, Croon, and Hagenaars (2004) demonstrated that such a three-step approach underestimates the associations between covariates and class membership. They proposed resolving this problem by means of a specific correction method that involves modifying the third step. In this article, I extend the correction method of Bolck, Croon, and Hagenaars by showing that it involves maximizing a weighted log-likelihood function for clustered data. This conceptualization makes it possible to apply the method not only with categorical but also with continuous explanatory variables, to obtain correct tests using complex sampling variance estimation methods, and to implement it in standard software for logistic regression analysis. In addition, a new maximum likelihood (ML)—based correction method is proposed, which is more direct in the sense that it does not require analyzing weighted data. This new three-step ML method can be easily implemented in software for LC analysis. The reported simulation study shows that both correction methods perform very well in the sense that their parameter estimates and their SEs can be trusted, except for situations with very poorly separated classes. The main advantage of the ML method compared with the Bolck, Croon, and Hagenaars approach is that it is much more efficient and almost as efficient as one-step ML estimation.},

	abstract = {The current study aimed to extend the results of White et al. (2015) by examining the moderating role of attention biases at age 5 on the relations between Behavioral Inhibition (BI) during toddlerhood and anxiety symptoms at age 10. Children's BI at 2 and 3 years of age was measured using laboratory assessments, and attention bias towards threat was assessed using a dot-probe task at age 5. Latent Class Analysis (LCA) was used to identify the probability for children's membership in an anxiety class, which reflected primary anxiety at age 10 that was not comorbid with symptoms of inattention. Maternal and self-report measures of children's mental health, collected via questionnaires and semi-structured diagnostic interviews, were used as indicators for the LCA. The results revealed that threat-related attention biases moderated the relation between BI and anxiety, such that BI positively predicted the probability of being in the anxiety class only when children had an attention bias towards threat. BI was unrelated to anxiety when children had no attention bias or an attention bias away from threat. These results indicated that attention biases during preschool may differentiate between inhibited children who are at heightened risk for anxiety later in childhood from those who are not. The results are discussed in a framework detailing the role of attention biases in increasing the sensitivity for anxiety-related problems in children who display high levels of BI during early childhood.},

A flexible model-based approach is proposed to empirically derive and summarize the class-dependent density functions of distal outcomes with categorical, continuous, or count distributions. A Monte Carlo simulation study is conducted to compare the performance of the new technique to two commonly used classify-analyze techniques: maximum-probability assignment and multiple pseudo-class draws. Simulation results show that the model-based approach produces substantially less biased estimates of the effect compared to either classify-analyze technique, particularly when the association between the latent class variable and the distal outcome is strong. In addition, we show that only the model-based approach is consistent. The approach is demonstrated empirically: latent classes of adolescent depression are used to predict smoking, grades, and delinquency.

	abstract = {The field of community psychology has focused on individuals' and groups' behavior in interaction with their social contexts, with an emphasis on prevention, early intervention, wellness promotion, and competency development. Over the past few decades, however, community-based applications of the newest research methodologies have not kept pace with the development of theory and methodology with regard to multilevel data collection and analysis.  The Handbook of Methodological Approaches to Community-Based Research is intended to aid the community-oriented researcher in learning about and applying cutting-edge quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods approaches. The Handbook presents a number of innovative methodologies relevant to community-based research, illustrating their applicability to specific social problems and projects. These methodological approaches explore individuals and groups in interaction with their communities and provide examples of how to implement and evaluate interventions conducted at the community level. The chapters discuss how particular methodologies can be used to help gather and analyze data dealing with community-based issues. Furthermore, they illustrate the benefits that occur when community theorists, interventionists, and methodologists work together to better understand complicated person-environment systems and the change processes within communities.},

	abstract = {The process of ovarian aging is influenced by a complex and poorly understood interplay of endocrine, metabolic, and environmental factors. The purpose of this study was to explore the feasibility of using latent class analysis to identify subgroups based on cardiometabolic, psychological, and reproductive parameters of health and to describe patterns of antiMüllerian hormone levels, a biomarker of the ovarian reserve, within these subgroups. Sixty-nine lean (body mass index [BMI] ⩽ 25 kg/m2) and severely obese (BMI ⩾ 40 kg/m2) postpartum women in Edinburgh, Scotland, were included in this exploratory study. The best fitting model included three classes: Class 1, n = 23 (33.5\%); Class 2, n = 30 (42.2\%); Class 3, n = 16 (24.3\%). Postpartum women with lower ovarian reserve had less favorable cardiometabolic and psychological profiles. Examining the ovarian reserve within distinct subgroups based on parameters of health that affect ovarian aging may facilitate risk stratification in the context of ovarian aging.},

	abstract = {One of the main variables in the Dutch Labour Force Survey is the variable measuring whether a respondent has a permanent or a temporary job. The aim of our study is to determine the measurement error in this variable by matching the information obtained by the longitudinal part of this survey with unique register data from the Dutch Institute for Employee Insurance. Contrary to previous approaches confronting such datasets, we take into account that also register data are not error-free and that measurement error in these data is likely to be correlated over time. More specifically, we propose the estimation of the measurement error in these two sources using an extended hidden Markov model with two observed indicators for the type of contract. Our results indicate that none of the two sources should be considered as error-free. For both indicators, we find that workers in temporary contracts are often misclassified as having a permanent contract. Particularly for the register data, we find that measurement errors are strongly autocorrelated, as, if made, they tend to repeat themselves. In contrast, when the register is correct, the probability of an error at the next time period is almost zero. Finally, we find that temporary contracts are more widespread than the Labour Force Survey suggests, while transition rates between temporary to permanent contracts are much less common than both datasets suggest.},

	abstract = {A simulation study compared the performance of robust normal theory maximum likelihood (ML) and robust categorical least squares (cat-LS) methodology for estimating confirmatory factor analysis models with ordinal variables. Data were generated from 2 models with 2–7 categories, 4 sample sizes, 2 latent distributions, and 5 patterns of category thresholds. Results revealed that factor loadings and robust standard errors were generally most accurately estimated using cat-LS, especially with fewer than 5 categories; however, factor correlations and model fit were assessed equally well with ML. Cat-LS was found to be more sensitive to sample size and to violations of the assumption of normality of the underlying continuous variables. Normal theory ML was found to be more sensitive to asymmetric category thresholds and was especially biased when estimating large factor loadings. Accordingly, we recommend cat-LS for data sets containing variables with fewer than 5 categories and ML when there are 5 or more categories, sample size is small, and category thresholds are approximately symmetric. With 6 –7 categories, results were similar across methods for many conditions; in these cases, either method is acceptable.},
