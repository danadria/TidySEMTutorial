	abstract = {Researchers are often interested in identifying homogeneous subgroups within heterogeneous samples on the basis of a set of measures, such as profiles of individuals’ motivation (i.e., their values, competence beliefs, and achievement goals). Latent Profile Analysis ({LPA}) is a statistical method for identifying such groups, or latent profiles, and is a special case of the general mixture model where all measured variables are continuous (Harring \& Hodis, 2016; Pastor, Barron, Miller, \& Davis, 2007). The {tidyLPA} package allows users to specify different models that determine whether and how different parameters (i.e., means, variances, and covariances) are estimated, and to specify and compare different solutions based on the number of profiles extracted.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: The Prospective Research in Stress-Related Military Operations ({PRISMO}) study was initiated to gain a better understanding of the long-term impact of military deployment on mental health, and to map the different biological and psychological factors that contribute to the development of stress-related mental health symptoms.
{PARTICIPANTS}: The {PRISMO} cohort consists of a convenience sample of Dutch military personnel deployed to Afghanistan between 2005 and 2008. Baseline data collection resulted in the recruitment of 1032 military men and women. Combat troops as well as non-combat support troops were recruited to increase the representativeness of the sample to the population as a whole.
{FINDINGS} {TO} {DATE}: The prevalence of various mental health symptoms increases after deployment in {PRISMO} cohort members, but symptom progression over time appears to be specific for various mental health symptoms. For post-traumatic stress disorder, we found a short-term symptom increase within 6 months after deployment (8.2\%), and a long-term symptom increase at 5 years after deployment (12.9\%). Several biological vulnerability factors associated with the development of stress-related conditions after deployment were identified, including predeployment glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity and predeployment testosterone level. Thus far, 34 publications have resulted from the cohort.
{FUTURE} {PLANS}: Various analyses are planned that will include the prevalence of mental health symptoms at 10 years postdeployment, as well as trajectory analyses that capture the longitudinal development of symptoms. Furthermore, we will use a machine learning approach to develop predictive and network models for several mental health symptoms, incorporating biological, psychological and social factors.},

            The algorithm has been tested against the Nelder and Mead simplex method and against a version of Adaptive Random Search. The test functions were Rosenbrock valleys and multiminima functions in 2,4, and 10 dimensions.
            The new method proved to be more reliable than the others, being always able to find the optimum, or at least a point very close to it. It is quite costly in term of function evaluations, but its cost can be predicted in advance, depending only slightly on the starting point.},

We study the asymptotic behaviour of the posterior distribution in a mixture model when the number of components in the mixture is larger than the true number of components: a situation which is commonly referred to as an overfitted mixture. We prove in particular that quite generally the posterior distribution has a stable and interesting behaviour, since it tends to empty the extra components. This stability is achieved under some restriction on the prior, which can be used as a guideline for choosing the prior. Some simulations are presented to illustrate this behaviour.},

Current practice in cognitive psychology is to accept a single model on the basis of only the “raw” {AIC} values, making it difficult to unambiguously interpret the observed {AIC} differences in terms of a continuous measure such as probability. Here we demonstrate that {AIC} values can be easily transformed to so-called Akaike weights (e.g., Akaike, 1978, 1979; Bozdogan, 1987; Burnham \& Anderson, 2002), which can be directly interpreted as conditional probabilities for each model. We show by example how these Akaike weights can greatly facilitate the interpretation of the results of {AIC} model comparison procedures.},

This 6-year longitudinal study investigated the link between adolescent empathy development and perceptions of the frequency of parent–child conflict, as reported by 467 adolescents (43 \% female, from age 13) and both parents. First, we investigated heterogeneity in empathy development by identifying classes of individuals with similar developmental trajectories. Adolescents were categorized into high-, average-, and low-empathy classes. Initial differences between these classes further increased from age 13 to 16, particularly for cognitive empathy. To assess the association between empathy and the frequency of conflict, we compared these empathy classes in terms of initial levels and over-time changes in the frequency of adolescent- and parent-reported conflict. Compared to the average- and high-empathy classes, the low-empathy class evidenced elevated conflict throughout adolescence. Furthermore, the low- and average-empathy classes demonstrated temporary divergence between adolescent- and parent-reported conflict from early- to mid-adolescence, with adolescents underreporting conflict compared to both parents. Adolescents’ agreement with parents was moderated by empathy class, while parents were always in agreement with one another. This may suggest that these discrepancies are related to distortions in adolescents’ perceptions, as opposed to biased parental reports. These findings highlight the potential importance of early detection and intervention in empathy deficiencies, and suggest that lower adolescent empathy may indicate elevated family conflict, even if a failure to consider parents’ perspective leads adolescents to underreport it.},

	abstract = {The main aim of the present study was to investigate the presence of Differential Item Functioning ({DIF}) using a latent class ({LC}) analysis approach. Particularly, we examined potential sources of {DIF} in relation to gender. Data came from 6,265 Saudi Arabia students, who completed a high-stakes standardized admission test for university entrance. The results from a Latent Class Analysis ({LCA}) revealed a three-class solution (i.e., high, average, and low scorers). Then, to better understand the nature of the emerging classes and the characteristics of the people who comprise them, we applied a new stepwise approach, using the Multiple Indicator Multiple Causes ({MIMIC}) model. The model identified both uniform and non-uniform {DIF} effects for several items across all scales of the test, although, for the majority of them, the {DIF} effect sizes were negligible. Findings from this study have important implications for both measurement quality and interpretation of the results. Particularly, results showed that gender is a potential source of {DIF} for latent class indicators; thus, it is important to include those direct effects in the latent class regression model, to obtain unbiased estimates not only for the measurement parameters but also of the structural parameters. Ignoring these effects might lead to misspecification of the latent classes in terms of both the size and the characteristics of each class, which in turn, could lead to misinterpretations of the obtained latent class results. Implications of the results for practice are discussed.},

Adolescents were categorized into high-, average-, and low-empathy classes. Initial differences between these classes further increased from age 13 to 16, particularly for cognitive empathy. To assess the association between empathy and the frequency of conflict, we compared these empathy classes in terms of initial levels and over-time changes in the frequency of adolescent- and parent-reported conflict. Compared to the average- and high-empathy classes, the low-empathy class evidenced elevated conflict throughout adolescence. Furthermore, the low- and average-empathy classes demonstrated temporary divergence between adolescent- and parent-reported conflict from early- to mid-adolescence, with adolescents underreporting conflict compared to both parents. Adolescents’ agreement with parents was moderated by empathy class, while parents were always in agreement with one another. This may suggest that these discrepancies are related to distortions in adolescents’ perceptions, as opposed to biased parental reports. These findings highlight the potential importance of early detection and intervention in empathy deficiencies, and suggest that lower adolescent empathy may indicate elevated family conflict, even if a failure to consider parents’ perspective leads adolescents to underreport it.},

Person-centered approaches (e.g., latent class analysis) have promise to identify unique risk profiles and subgroups in the larger population. The current study identified latent subgroups characterized by prior self-directed violence history and proximal risk factors for suicide among suicide attempt survivors, and compared subgroups on demographics and most-lethal attempt characteristics. Participants included civilians and {SMVs} reporting lifetime suicide attempt(s) (n = 2643) from the Military Suicide Research Consortium. Two classes emerged from Common Data Elements: suicide attempt and non-suicidal self-injury frequency, suicide attempt method, perceived likelihood of future suicide, suicide disclosure, suicide intent, and perceived and actual lethality of attempt. A Higher-Risk History class was characterized by greater intent to die, certainty about attempt fatality and method lethality, belief injury would be medically unfixable, and likelihood of prior non-suicidal self-injury. A Lower-Risk History class was characterized by greater ambivalence toward death and methods. Higher-Risk class members were more likely to be male, older, {SMVs}, have less formal education, use firearms as most-lethal attempt method, and require a higher degree of medical attention. Lower-Risk class members were more likely to be female, civilian, use cutting as most-lethal attempt method, and require less medical attention for attempts. Findings have implications for risk assessments and highlight the importance of subjective perceptions about suicidal behavior. Further investigation of real-time individual-level is necessary, especially for {SMVs} who may be at greatest risk for potentially lethal suicidal behavior.},

Performance on a stressful concept-attainment task, patterns of goal setting, authoritarianism, and vulnerability to self-esteem change were dependent variables. Ss higher in ego identity performed best on the concept-attainment task; those in the status characterized by adherence to parental wishes set goals unrealistically high and subscribed significantly more to authoritarian values.

Regions are distinct socio-political contexts in relation to migration and integration dynamics. Hence, this study investigates for different combinations of national, heritage and regional identities (i.e. Flemish, Belgian and Turkish or Moroccan) the relationship between students’ experiences with teacher ethnic/racial discrimination and students’ depressive feelings. Latent Class Analysis of survey data involving a sample of 439 adolescents (Mage = 18, {SD} = 0.93; Girls = 49\%) with Turkish (41\%) or Moroccan origin in Flanders, shows three identification classes: full integration (35\%), national integration (40\%) and (weak) separation (24\%). All these identity profiles had in common that heritage identification was high, yet they were highly distinct due to variation in national and regional identification. Additional, multilevel modelling showed that nationally integrated adolescents were less depressed than fully integrated adolescents. This finding illustrates the importance of adolescents’ identity multiplicity for understanding their resilience in relation to teacher discrimination.},

Data were generated from 2 models with 2–7 categories, 4 sample sizes, 2 latent distributions, and 5 patterns of category thresholds. Results revealed that factor loadings and robust standard errors were generally most accurately estimated using cat-{LS}, especially with fewer than 5 categories; however, factor correlations and model fit were assessed equally well with {ML}. Cat-{LS} was found to be more sensitive to sample size and to violations of the assumption of normality of the underlying continuous variables. Normal theory {ML} was found to be more sensitive to asymmetric category thresholds and was especially biased when estimating large factor loadings. Accordingly, we recommend cat-{LS} for data sets containing variables with fewer than 5 categories and {ML} when there are 5 or more categories, sample size is small, and category thresholds are approximately symmetric. With 6–7 categories, results were similar across methods for many conditions; in these cases, either method is acceptable. ({PsycInfo} Database Record (c) 2020 {APA}, all rights reserved)},

The aim of our study is to determine the measurement error in this variable by matching the information obtained by the longitudinal part of this survey with unique register data from the Dutch Institute for Employee Insurance. Contrary to previous approaches confronting such datasets, we take into account that also register data are not error-free and that measurement error in these data is likely to be correlated over time. More speciﬁcally, we propose the estimation of the measurement error in these two sources using an extended hidden Markov model with two observed indicators for the type of contract. Our results indicate that none of the two sources should be considered as error-free. For both indicators, we ﬁnd that workers in temporary contracts are often misclassiﬁed as having a permanent contract. Particularly for the register data, we ﬁnd that measurement errors are strongly autocorrelated, as, if made, they tend to repeat themselves. In contrast, when the register is correct, the probability of an error at the next time period is almost zero. Finally, we ﬁnd that temporary contracts are more widespread than the Labour Force Survey suggests, while transition rates between temporary to permanent contracts are much less common than both datasets suggest.},

Sixty-nine lean (body mass index [{BMI}] ? 25 kg/m2) and severely obese ({BMI} ? 40 kg/m2) postpartum women in Edinburgh, Scotland, were included in this exploratory study. The best fitting model included three classes: Class 1, n = 23 (33.5\%); Class 2, n = 30 (42.2\%); Class 3, n = 16 (24.3\%). Postpartum women with lower ovarian reserve had less favorable cardiometabolic and psychological profiles. Examining the ovarian reserve within distinct subgroups based on parameters of health that affect ovarian aging may facilitate risk stratification in the context of ovarian aging.},

	shorttitle = {Latent Class and Latent Transition Analysis},
	abstract = {A modern, comprehensive treatment of latent class and latent transition analysis for categorical data On a daily basis, researchers in the social, behavioral, and health sciences collect information and fit statistical models to the gathered empirical data with the goal of making significant advances in these fields. In many cases, it can be useful to identify latent, or unobserved, subgroups in a population, where individuals' subgroup membership is inferred from their responses on a set of observed variables. Latent Class and Latent Transition Analysis provides a comprehensive and unified introduction to this topic through one-of-a-kind, step-by-step presentations and coverage of theoretical, technical, and practical issues in categorical latent variable modeling for both cross-sectional and longitudinal data. The book begins with an introduction to latent class and latent transition analysis for categorical data. Subsequent chapters delve into more in-depth material, featuring:   A complete treatment of longitudinal latent class models   Focused coverage of the conceptual underpinnings of interpretation and evaluationof a latent class solution   Use of parameter restrictions and detection of identification problems   Advanced topics such as multi-group analysis and the modeling and interpretation of interactions between covariates   The authors present the topic in a style that is accessible yet rigorous. Each method is presented with both a theoretical background and the practical information that is useful for any data analyst. Empirical examples showcase the real-world applications of the discussed concepts and models, and each chapter concludes with a "Points to Remember" section that contains a brief summary of key ideas. All of the analyses in the book are performed using Proc {LCA} and Proc {LTA}, the authors' own software packages that can be run within the {SAS}® environment. A related Web site houses information on these freely available programs and the book's data sets, encouraging readers to reproduce the analyses and also try their own variations. Latent Class and Latent Transition Analysis is an excellent book for courses on categorical data analysis and latent variable models at the upper-undergraduate and graduate levels. It is also a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the social, behavioral, and health sciences who conduct latent class and latent transition analysis in their everyday work.},

The Handbook of Methodological Approaches to Community-Based Research is intended to aid the community-oriented researcher in learning about and applying cutting-edge quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods approaches. The Handbook presents a number of innovative methodologies relevant to community-based research, illustrating their applicability to specific social problems and projects. These methodological approaches explore individuals and groups in interaction with their communities and provide examples of how to implement and evaluate interventions conducted at the community level. The chapters discuss how particular methodologies can be used to help gather and analyze data dealing with community-based issues. Furthermore, they illustrate the benefits that occur when community theorists, interventionists, and methodologists work together to better understand complicated person-environment systems and the change processes within communities.},

	title = {The Lazy Bootstrap. A Fast Resampling Method for Evaluating Latent Class Model Fit},
	abstract = {The latent class model is a powerful unsupervised clustering algorithm for categorical data. Many statistics exist to test the ﬁt of the latent class model. However, traditional methods to evaluate those ﬁt statistics are not always useful. Asymptotic distributions are not always known, and empirical reference distributions can be very time consuming to obtain. In this paper we propose a fast resampling scheme with which any type of model ﬁt can be assessed. We illustrate it here on the latent class model, but the methodology can be applied in any situation. The principle behind the lazy bootstrap method is to specify a statistic which captures the characteristics of the data that a model should capture correctly. If those characteristics in the observed data and in model-generated data are very diﬀerent we can assume that the model could not have produced the observed data. With this method we achieve the ﬂexibility of tests from the Bayesian framework, while only needing maximum likelihood estimates. We provide a step-wise algorithm with which the ﬁt of a model can be assessed based on the characteristics we as researcher ﬁnd important. In a Monte Carlo study we show that the method has very low type I errors, for all illustrated statistics. Power to reject a model depended largely on the type of statistic that was used and on sample size. We applied the method to an empirical data set on clinical subgroups with risk of Myocardial infarction and compared the results directly to the parametric bootstrap. The results of our method were highly similar to those obtained by the parametric bootstrap, while the required computations diﬀered three orders of magnitude in favour of our method.},

A Monte Carlo simulation study is conducted to compare the performance of the new technique to two commonly used classify-analyze techniques: maximum-probability assignment and multiple pseudo-class draws. Simulation results show that the model-based approach produces substantially less biased estimates of the effect compared to either classify-analyze technique, particularly when the association between the latent class variable and the distal outcome is strong. In addition, we show that only the model-based approach is consistent. The approach is demonstrated empirically: latent classes of adolescent depression are used to predict smoking, grades, and delinquency. {SAS} syntax for implementing this approach using {PROC} {LCA} and a corresponding macro are provided.},

Children's {BI} at 2 and 3 years of age was measured using laboratory assessments, and attention bias towards threat was assessed using a dot-probe task at age 5. Latent Class Analysis ({LCA}) was used to identify the probability for children's membership in an anxiety class, which reflected primary anxiety at age 10 that was not comorbid with symptoms of inattention. Maternal and self-report measures of children's mental health, collected via questionnaires and semi-structured diagnostic interviews, were used as indicators for the {LCA}. The results revealed that threat-related attention biases moderated the relation between {BI} and anxiety, such that {BI} positively predicted the probability of being in the anxiety class only when children had an attention bias towards threat. {BI} was unrelated to anxiety when children had no attention bias or an attention bias away from threat. These results indicated that attention biases during preschool may differentiate between inhibited children who are at heightened risk for anxiety later in childhood from those who are not. The results are discussed in a framework detailing the role of attention biases in increasing the sensitivity for anxiety-related problems in children who display high levels of {BI} during early childhood.},

	abstract = {Researchers using latent class ({LC}) analysis often proceed using the following three steps: (1) an {LC} model is built for a set of response variables, (2) subjects are assigned to {LCs} based on their posterior class membership probabilities, and (3) the association between the assigned class membership and external variables is investigated using simple cross-tabulations or multinomial logistic regression analysis. Bolck, Croon, and Hagenaars (2004) demonstrated that such a three-step approach underestimates the associations between covariates and class membership. They proposed resolving this problem by means of a specific correction method that involves modifying the third step. In this article, I extend the correction method of Bolck, Croon, and Hagenaars by showing that it involves maximizing a weighted log-likelihood function for clustered data. This conceptualization makes it possible to apply the method not only with categorical but also with continuous explanatory variables, to obtain correct tests using complex sampling variance estimation methods, and to implement it in standard software for logistic regression analysis. In addition, a new maximum likelihood ({ML})—based correction method is proposed, which is more direct in the sense that it does not require analyzing weighted data. This new three-step {ML} method can be easily implemented in software for {LC} analysis. The reported simulation study shows that both correction methods perform very well in the sense that their parameter estimates and their {SEs} can be trusted, except for situations with very poorly separated classes. The main advantage of the {ML} method compared with the Bolck, Croon, and Hagenaars approach is that it is much more efficient and almost as efficient as one-step {ML} estimation.},

	abstract = {In maximum likelihood estimation of latent class models, it often occurs that one or more of the parameter estimates are on the boundary of the parameter space; that is, that estimated probabilities equal 0 (or 1) or, equivalently, that logit coefficients equal minus (or plus) infinity. This not only causes numerical problems in the computation of the variance-covariance matrix, it also makes the reported confidence intervals and significance tests for the parameters concerned meaningless. Boundary estimates can, however, easily be prevented by the use of prior distributions for the model parameters, yielding a Bayesian procedure called posterior mode or maximum a posteriori estimation. This approach is implemented in, for example, the Latent {GOLD} software packages for latent class analysis (Vermunt \& Magidson, 2005). Little is, however, known about the quality of posterior mode estimates of the parameters of latent class models, nor about their sensitivity for the choice of the prior distribution. In this paper, we compare the quality of various types of posterior mode point and interval estimates for the parameters of latent class models with both the classical maximum likelihood estimates and the bootstrap estimates proposed by De Menezes (1999). Our simulation study shows that parameter estimates and standard errors obtained by the Bayesian approach are more reliable than the corresponding parameter estimates and standard errors obtained by maximum likelihood and parametric bootstrapping.},

Participants were over 2,000 sixth grade students who completed peer nomination procedures that identified students who had reputations as perpetrators and/or victims of physical, verbal, or relational harassment. Results showed five latent classes. Consistent with previous research, {LCA} identified latent classes of victims, aggressors, and socially adjusted students. However, rather than a single aggressive-victim subgroup, {LCA} identified latent classes of highly-victimized aggressive-victims and highly-aggressive aggressive-victims.

We used latent class analysis ({LCA}) to identify risk profiles and, with covariates, to identify predictors of class., Results. A 4-class model of risk profiles fit the data best: (1) solitary users reported polydrug use at the individual level, but low probabilities of substance use or concurrent sexual partners with network members; (2) social–all-substance users reported polydrug use at the individual and network levels; (3) social–noninjection drug users reported less likelihood of injection drug and solvent use; (4) low-risk users reported low probabilities across substances. Unstable housing, preadolescent substance use, age, and hepatitis C status predicted risk profiles., Conclusions. Incorporation of social network variables into {LCA} can distinguish important subgroups with varying patterns of risk behaviors that can lead to sexually transmitted and bloodborne infections.},

Within this article, we (a) review the existing applications of {LPA} within past vocational behavior research; (b) illustrate best practice procedures in a non-technical way of how to use {LPA} methodology, with an illustrative example of identifying different latent profiles of heavy work investment (i.e., working compulsively, working excessively, and work engagement); and (c) outline future research possibilities in vocational behavior research. By reviewing 46 studies stemming from central journals of the field, we identified seven distinct topics that have already been investigated by {LPA} (e.g., job and organizational attitudes and behaviors, work motivation, career-related attitudes and orientations, vocational interests). Together with showing descriptive statistics about how {LPA} has been conducted in past vocational behavior research, we illustrate and derive best-practice recommendations for future {LPA} research.

Maximum likelihood ({ML}) estimates may behave poorly over repeated samples, and the abnormal shape of the likelihood often makes it difficult to assess the uncertainty in parameter estimates. Bayesian inference via Markov chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC}) can be a useful alternative to {ML}, but the component labels may switch during the {MCMC} run, making the output difficult to interpret. Two basic methods for handling the label-switching problem have been proposed: imposing constraints on the parameter space and cluster-based relabeling of the simulated parameters. We have found that label switching may also be reduced by supplying small amounts of prior information that are asymmetric with respect to the mixture components. Simply assigning one observation to each component a priori may effectively eliminate the problem. Using a very simple example—a univariate sample from a mixture of two exponentials—we evaluate the performance of likelihood and {MCMC}-based estimates and intervals over repeated sampling. Our simulations show that {MCMC} performs much better than {ML} if the label-switching problem is adequately addressed, and that asymmetric prior information performs as well as or better than the other proposed methods.},

The method is becoming more commonly used in child mental health research, but there are reservations about the replicability, reliability, and validity of findings.Objective: A systematic literature review was conducted to investigate the extent to which {LCA} has been used to study population mental health in children, and whether replicable, reliable and valid findings have been demonstrated.Methods: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses ({PRISMA}) guidelines were followed. A search of literature, published between January 1998 and December 2017, was carried out using {MEDLINE}, {EMBASE}, {PsycInfo}, Scopus, {ERIC}, {ASSIA}, and Google Scholar. A total of 2,748 studies were initially identified, of which 23 were eligible for review. The review examined the methods which studies had used to choose the number of mental health classes, the classes that they found, and whether there was evidence for the validity and reliability of the classes.Results: Reviewed studies used {LCA} to investigate both disparate mental health symptoms, and those associated with specific disorders. The corpus of studies using similar indicators was small. Differences in the criteria used to select the final {LCA} model were found between studies. All studies found meaningful or useful subgroups, but there were differences in the extent to which the validity and reliability of classes were explicitly demonstrated.Conclusions : {LCA} is a useful tool for studying and classifying child mental health at the population level. Recommendations are made to improve the application and reporting of {LCA} and to increase confidence in findings in the future, including use of a range of indices and criteria when enumerating classes, clear reporting of methods for replicability, and making efforts to establish the validity and reliability of identified classes.},

Major issues discussed in this book include identifiability problems, actual fitting of finite mixtures through use of the {EM} algorithm, properties of the maximum likelihood estimators so obtained, assessment of the number of components to be used in the mixture, and the applicability of asymptotic theory in providing a basis for the solutions to some of these problems. The author also considers how the {EM} algorithm can be scaled to handle the fitting of mixture models to very large databases, as in data mining applications. This comprehensive, practical guide: * Provides more than 800 references-40\% published since 1995 * Includes an appendix listing available mixture software * Links statistical literature with machine learning and pattern recognition literature * Contains more than 100 helpful graphs, charts, and tables Finite Mixture Models is an important resource for both applied and theoretical statisticians as well as for researchers in the many areas in which finite mixture models can be used to analyze data.},

The assumption underlying {LCA} is that membership in unobserved groups (or classes) can be explained by patterns of scores across survey questions, assessment indicators, or scales. The application of {LCA} is an active area of research and continues to evolve. As more researchers begin to apply the approach, detailed information on key considerations in conducting {LCA} is needed. In the present article, we describe {LCA}, review key elements to consider when conducting {LCA}, and provide an example of its application.},

Model selection is one of the most important problems in mixture cluster analysis based on the mixture of multivariate normal distributions. Model selection involves the determination of the number of components (clusters) and the selection of an appropriate covariance structure in the mixture cluster analysis. In this study, the efficiency of information criteria that are commonly used in model selection is examined. The effectiveness of information criteria has been determined according to the success in the selection of the number of components and in the selection of an appropriate covariance matrix.},

	abstract = {This article compares two missing data procedures, full information maximum likelihood ({FIML}) and multiple imputation ({MI}), to investigate their relative performances in relation to the results from analyses of the original complete data or the hypothetical data available before missingness occurred. By expressing the {FIML} estimator as a special {MI} estimator, we predicted the expected patterns of discrepancy between the two estimators. Via Monte Carlo simulation studies where we have access to the original complete data, we compare the performance of {FIML} and {MI} estimators to that of the complete data maximum likelihood ({ML}) estimator under a wide range of conditions, including differences in sample size, percent of missingness, and degrees of model misfit. Our study confirmed well-known knowledge that the two estimators tend to yield essentially equivalent results to each other and to those from analysis of complete data when the postulated model is correctly specified. However, some noteworthy patterns of discrepancies were found between the {FIML} and {MI} estimators when the hypothesized model does not hold exactly in the population: {MI}-based parameter estimates, comparative fit index ({CFI}), and the Tucker Lewis index ({TLI}) tend to be closer to the counterparts of the complete data {ML} estimates, whereas {FIML}-based chi-squares and root mean square error of approximation ({RMSEA}) tend to be closer to the counterparts of the complete data {ML} estimates. We explained the observed patterns of discrepancy between the two estimators as a function of the interplay between the parsimony and accuracy of the imputation model. We concluded by discussing practical and methodological implications and issues for further research. ({PsycInfo} Database Record (c) 2021 {APA}, all rights reserved)},

While some of these criticisms are well-founded, frequently the use of various parametric methods such as analysis of variance, regression, correlation are faulted because: (a) the sample size is too small, (b) the data may not be normally distributed, or (c) The data are from Likert scales, which are ordinal, so parametric statistics cannot be used. In this paper, I dissect these arguments, and show that many studies, dating back to the 1930s consistently show that parametric statistics are robust with respect to violations of these assumptions. Hence, challenges like those above are unfounded, and parametric methods can be utilized without concern for “getting the wrong answer”.},

I agree with the authors’ conclusion that the performance of {KM} may be equal to {MMC} in certain situations, which are primarily the situations investigated by Steinley and Brusco. However, a weakness of the paper is the failure to investigate many important real-world situations where theory suggests that {MMC} should outperform {KM}. This article elaborates on the {KM}–{MMC} comparison in terms of cluster recovery and provides some additional simulation results that show that {KM} may be much worse than {MMC}.

They are based on random initialization, using a classification {EM} algorithm ({CEM}), a Stochastic {EM} algorithm ({SEM}) or previous short runs of {EM} itself. Those initializations are included in a search/run/select strategy which can be compounded by repeating the three steps. They are compared in the context of multivariate Gaussian mixtures on the basis of numerical experiments on both simulated and real data sets in a target number of iterations. The main conclusions of those numerical experiments are the following. The simple random initialization which is probably the most employed way of initiating {EM} is often outperformed by strategies using {CEM}, {SEM} or shorts runs of {EM} before running {EM}. Also, it appears that compounding is generally profitable since using a single run of {EM} can often lead to suboptimal solutions. Otherwise, none of the experimental strategies can be regarded as the best one and it is difficult to characterize situations where a particular strategy can be expected to outperform the other ones. However, the strategy initiating {EM} with short runs of {EM} can be recommended. This strategy, which as far as we know was not used before the present study, has some advantages. It is simple, performs well in a lot of situations presupposing no particular form of the mixture to be fitted to the data and seems little sensitive to noisy data.},

In a recent study of 5409 serum samples from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ({NHANES} {III}), a finite mixture model was developed to examine the distribution of immunoglobulin G ({IgG}) antibody levels against pertussis toxin ({PT}), an antigen specific to the Bordetella pertussis bacterium. The mixture model identified three component populations with antibody levels greater than the quantitative assay's lower limit of quantitation ({LLQ}) and included a point distribution located at or below the {LLQ} to account for the excess number of antibody values that fell below the {LLQ}. The mixture model analysis accounted for the {NHANES} {III} design. A cut-off point for anti-{PT} {IgG} levels was chosen to have a 99 per cent model specificity based on the two overlapping normal distributions assumed for the two component populations with the highest antibody levels. This cut-off point may have a higher diagnostic sensitivity for acute B. pertussis infection than other cut-off points derived by assuming a single distribution for antibody levels.

The adjective ªunsupervisedº is justified by two properties of the algorithm: 1) it is capable of selecting the number of components and 2) unlike the standard expectation-maximization ({EM}) algorithm, it does not require careful initialization. The proposed method also avoids another drawback of {EM} for mixture fitting: the possibility of convergence toward a singular estimate at the boundary of the parameter space. The novelty of our approach is that we do not use a model selection criterion to choose one among a set of preestimated candidate models; instead, we seamlessly integrate estimation and model selection in a single algorithm. Our technique can be applied to any type of parametric mixture model for which it is possible to write an {EM} algorithm; in this paper, we illustrate it with experiments involving Gaussian mixtures. These experiments testify for the good performance of our approach.},

Despite mixture models' usefulness in practice, one unresolved issue in the application of mixture models is that there is not one commonly accepted statistical indicator for deciding on the number of classes in a study population. This article presents the results of a simulation study that examines the performance of likelihood-based tests and the traditionally used Information Criterion ({ICs}) used for determining the number of classes in mixture modeling. We look at the performance of these tests and indexes for 3 types of mixture models: latent class analysis ({LCA}), a factor mixture model ({FMA}), and a growth mixture models ({GMM}). We evaluate the ability of the tests and indexes to correctly identify the number of classes at three different sample sizes (n = 200, 500, 1,000). Whereas the Bayesian Information Criterion performed the best of the {ICs}, the bootstrap likelihood ratio test proved to be a very consistent indicator of classes across all of the models considered.},

In this article, we provide answers to 10 frequently asked questions about {LCA}. The questions included in this article were fielded from our experience consulting with applied researchers interested in using {LCA}. The major topics include a general introduction in the {LCA}; an overview of class enumeration (e.g., deciding on the number of classes), including commonly used statistical fit indices; substantive interpretation of {LCA} solutions; estimation of covariates and distal outcome relations to the latent class variable; data requirements for {LCA}; software choices and considerations; distinctions and similarities among {LCA} and related latent variable models; and extensions of the {LCA} model. To illustrate the modeling ideas described in this article, we present an applied example using {LCA}. Specifically, we use {LCA} to model individual differences in positive youth development among college students and analyze demographic characteristics as covariates and a distal outcome of overall life satisfaction. We also include key references that direct readers to more detailed and technical discussions of these topics for which we provide an applied and introductory overview. We conclude by mentioning future developments in research and practice, including advanced cross-sectional and longitudinal extensions of {LCA}.},

	abstract = {A common concern when faced with multivariate data with missing values is whether the missing data are missing completely at random ({MCAR}); that is, whether missingness depends on the variables in the data set. One way of assessing this is to compare the means of recorded values of each variable between groups defined by whether other variables in the data set are missing or not. Although informative, this procedure yields potentially many correlated statistics for testing {MCAR}, resulting in multiple-comparison problems. This article proposes a single global test statistic for {MCAR} that uses all of the available data. The asymptotic null distribution is given, and the small-sample null distribution is derived for multivariate normal data with a monotone pattern of missing data. The test reduces to a standard t test when the data are bivariate with missing data confined to a single variable. A limited simulation study of empirical sizes for the test applied to normal and nonnormal data suggests that the test is conservative for small samples.},

To overcome this issue, using a 4-round Delphi study, we developed Guidelines for Reporting on Latent Trajectory Studies ({GRoLTS}). The purpose of {GRoLTS} is to present criteria that should be included when reporting the results of latent trajectory analysis across research fields. We have gone through a systematic process to identify key components that, according to a panel of experts, are necessary when reporting results for trajectory studies. We applied {GRoLTS} to 38 papers where {LGMM} or {LCGA} was used to study trajectories of posttraumatic stress after a traumatic event.},

	abstract = {Test of homogeneity of covariances (or homoscedasticity) among several groups has many applications in statistical analysis. In the context of incomplete data analysis, tests of homoscedasticity among groups of cases with identical missing data patterns have been proposed to test whether data are missing completely at random ({MCAR}). These tests of {MCAR} require large sample sizes n and/or large group sample sizes ni, and they usually fail when applied to nonnormal data. Hawkins (Technometrics 23:105–110, 1981) proposed a test of multivariate normality and homoscedasticity that is an exact test for complete data when ni are small. This paper proposes a modification of this test for complete data to improve its performance, and extends its application to test of homoscedasticity and {MCAR} when data are multivariate normal and incomplete. Moreover, it is shown that the statistic used in the Hawkins test in conjunction with a nonparametric k-sample test can be used to obtain a nonparametric test of homoscedasticity that works well for both normal and nonnormal data. It is explained how a combination of the proposed normal-theory Hawkins test and the nonparametric test can be employed to test for homoscedasticity, {MCAR}, and multivariate normality. Simulation studies show that the newly proposed tests generally outperform their existing competitors in terms of Type I error rejection rates. Also, a power study of the proposed tests indicates good power. The proposed methods use appropriate missing data imputations to impute missing data. Methods of multiple imputation are described and one of the methods is employed to confirm the result of our single imputation methods. Examples are provided where multiple imputation enables one to identify a group or groups whose covariance matrices differ from the majority of other groups.},

In this tutorial, we demonstrate how the R package repro supports researchers in creating fully computationally reproducible research projects with tools from the software engineering community. Building upon this notion of fully automated reproducibility, we present several applications including the preregistration of research plans with code (Preregistration as Code, {PAC}). {PAC} eschews all ambiguity of traditional preregistration and offers several more advantages. Making technical advancements that serve reproducibility more widely accessible for researchers holds the potential to innovate the research process and to help it become more productive, credible, and reliable.},

This paper introduces the Workflow for Open Reproducible Code in Science ({WORCS}): A step-by-step procedure that researchers can follow to make a research project open and reproducible. This workflow intends to lower the threshold for adoption of open science principles. It is based on established best practices, and can be used either in parallel to, or in absence of, top-down requirements by journals, institutions, and funding bodies. To facilitate widespread adoption, the {WORCS} principles have been implemented in the R package worcs , which offers an {RStudio} project template and utility functions for specific workflow steps. This paper introduces the conceptual workflow, discusses how it meets different standards for open science, and addresses the functionality provided by the R implementation, worcs . This paper is primarily targeted towards scholars conducting research projects in R, conducting research that involves academic prose, analysis code, and tabular data. However, the workflow is flexible enough to accommodate other scenarios, and offers a starting point for customized solutions.

Latent Class Growth Analysis ({LCGA}) was used to identify developmental typologies of both identity formation (i.e., dimensions of commitment and exploration) and adjustment (i.e., depressive symptoms and self-esteem). Four trajectory classes emerged for identity, three of which had been suggested earlier in the literature (Josselson, 1996): Pathmakers, Guardians, and Searchers. The fourth trajectory class was labeled Consolidators and consisted of individuals characterized by a strong focus on strengthening their current identity commitments, at the expense of a thorough exploration of alternative options. Three trajectory classes were identified for adjustment: Optimal Adjustment, Moderate Adjustment, and Stable Maladjustment. Each of the four identity trajectory classes was associated with a specific profile of adjustment, with the Searchers showing the poorest profile and the Pathmakers and Consolidators the most positive profile.

	abstract = {{depmixS}4 implements a general framework for defining and estimating dependent mixture models in the R programming language.  This includes standard Markov models, latent/hidden Markov models, and latent class and finite mixture distribution models.  The models can be fitted on mixed multivariate data with distributions from the glm family, the (logistic) multinomial, or the multivariate normal distribution.  Other distributions can be added easily, and an example is provided with the exgaus distribution.  Parameters are estimated by the expectation-maximization ({EM}) algorithm or, when (linear) constraints are imposed on the parameters, by direct numerical optimization with the Rsolnp or Rdonlp2 routines.},

	abstract = {This chapter provides a state-of-the-art overview of the use of mixture and latent class models for the analysis of longitudinal data. It first describes the three basic types mixture models for longitudinal data: the mixture growth, mixture Markov, and latent Markov model. Subsequently, it presents an integrating framework merging various recent developments in software and algorithms, yielding mixture models for longitudinal data that can (1) not only be used with categorical, but also with continuous response variables (as well as combinations of these), (2) be used with very long time series, (3) include covariates (which can be numeric or categorical, as well as time-constant or time-varying), (4) include parameter restrictions yielding interesting measurement models, and (5) deal with missing values (which is very important in longitudinal research). Moreover, it discusses other advanced models, such as latent Markov models with dependent classification errors across time points, mixture growth and latent Markov models with random effects, and latent Markov models for multilevel data and multiple processes. The appendix shows how the presented models can be defined using the Latent {GOLD} syntax system (Vermunt and Magidson, 2005, 2008).},

This simulation study examined power related to interclass distance between latent classes given true number of classes, sample size, and number of indicators. Seven model selection methods were evaluated. None had adequate power to select the correct number of classes with a small (Cohen's d = .2) or medium (d = .5) degree of separation. With a very large degree of separation (d = 1.5), the Lo–Mendell–Rubin test ({LMR}), adjusted {LMR}, bootstrap likelihood ratio test, Bayesian Information Criterion ({BIC}), and sample-size-adjusted {BIC} were good at selecting the correct number of classes. However, with a large degree of separation (d = .8), power depended on number of indicators and sample size. Akaike's Information Criterion and entropy poorly selected the correct number of classes, regardless of degree of separation, number of indicators, or sample size.},

	abstract = {Researchers using latent class ({LC}) analysis often proceed using the following three steps: (1) an {LC} model is built for a set of response variables, (2) subjects are assigned to {LCs} based on their posterior class membership probabilities, and (3) the association between the assigned class membership and external variables is investigated using simple cross-tabulations or multinomial logistic regression analysis. Bolck, Croon, and Hagenaars (2004) demonstrated that such a three-step approach underestimates the associations between covariates and class membership. They proposed resolving this problem by means of a specific correction method that involves modifying the third step. In this article, I extend the correction method of Bolck, Croon, and Hagenaars by showing that it involves maximizing a weighted log-likelihood function for clustered data. This conceptualization makes it possible to apply the method not only with categorical but also with continuous explanatory variables, to obtain correct tests using complex sampling variance estimation methods, and to implement it in standard software for logistic regression analysis. In addition, a new maximum likelihood ({ML})—based correction method is proposed, which is more direct in the sense that it does not require analyzing weighted data. This new three-step {ML} method can be easily implemented in software for {LC} analysis. The reported simulation study shows that both correction methods perform very well in the sense that their parameter estimates and their {SEs} can be trusted, except for situations with very poorly separated classes. The main advantage of the {ML} method compared with the Bolck, Croon, and Hagenaars approach is that it is much more efficient and almost as efficient as one-step {ML} estimation.},

Such models have a measurement part (essentially the latent class model) and a structural (causal) part (essentially a system of logit equations). In the three-step approach, a stand-alone measurement model is first defined and its parameters are estimated. Individual predicted scores on the latent variables are then computed from the parameter estimates of the measurement model and the individual observed scoring patterns on the indicators. Finally, these predicted scores are used in the causal part and treated as observed variables. We show that such a naive use of predicted latent scores cannot be recommended since it leads to a systematic underestimation of the strength of the association among the variables in the structural part of the models. However, a simple correction procedure can eliminate this systematic bias. This approach is illustrated on simulated and real data. A method that uses multiple imputation to account for the fact that the predicted latent variables are random variables can produce standard errors for the parameters in the structural part of the model.},

	abstract = {Growth mixture model ({GMM}) is a flexible statistical technique for analyzing longitudinal data when there are unknown heterogeneous subpopulations with different growth trajectories. When individuals are nested within clusters, multilevel growth mixture model ({MGMM}) should be used to account for the clustering effect. A review of recent literature shows that a higher level of nesting was described in 43\% of articles using {GMM}, none of which used {MGMM} to account for the clustered data. We conjecture that researchers sometimes ignore the higher level to reduce analytical complexity, but in other situations, ignoring the nesting is unavoidable. This Monte Carlo study investigated whether the correct number of classes can still be retrieved when a higher level of nesting in {MGMM} is ignored. We investigated six commonly used model selection indices: Akaike information criterion ({AIC}), consistent {AIC} ({CAIC}), Bayesian information criterion ({BIC}), sample size–adjusted {BIC} ({SABIC}), Vuong–Lo–Mendell–Rubin likelihood ratio test ({VLMR}), and adjusted Lo–Mendell–Rubin likelihood ratio test ({ALMR}). Results showed that accuracy of class enumeration decreased for all six indices when the higher level is ignored. {BIC}, {CAIC}, and {SABIC} were the most effective model selection indices under the misspecified model. {BIC} and {CAIC} were preferable when sample size was large and/or intraclass correlation ({ICC}) was small, whereas {SABIC} performed better when sample size was small and/or {ICC} was large. In addition, {SABIC} and {VLMR}/{ALMR} tended to overextract the number of classes when there are more than two subpopulations and the sample size is large.},

The topics in this article include an introduction to the grammar by working through the process of creating a plot, and discussing the components that we need. The grammar is then presented formally and compared to Wilkinson’s grammar, highlighting the hierarchy of defaults, and the implications of embedding a graphical grammar into a programming language. The power of the grammar is illustrated with a selection of examples that explore different components and their interactions, in more detail.

	abstract = {Zero responses and their equivalents—for example, never, none, not at all—are commonly observed on measures of psychopathology inquiring about symptom frequencies, particularly when these measures are administered to community samples. Measurement researchers typically accommodate multivariate zero inflation by including a nonpathological class of respondents who endorse zero for all symptoms. While this latent class approach accounts for test-level zero inflation (i.e., a proportion of individuals who do not experience any of the symptoms), it may be overly restrictive on questionnaires comprising items of differing severity. For example, an item about suicidal ideation is likely to exhibit a much higher degree of zero inflation than an item about low energy. Existing models do not account for this variability. We propose a multidimensional zero-inflated graded response model ({MZI}-{GRM}) as a more flexible approach for modeling zero inflation on questionnaires. According to the model, two distinct but correlated latent variables underlie ordinal item responses; one represents susceptibility to the construct, whereas the other represents severity. As a motivating example, we show how the {MZI}-{GRM} can be fit to data from the {PHQ}-9, a common depression screener. Results suggest that the {MZI}-{GRM} is better able to capture zero inflation across items than existing alternative models. Further, we find support for a multidimensional model that allows distinct but correlated latent variables to underlie each response process. Some items better measure susceptibility to depression (symptom presence), whereas others better capture severity of depression (symptom frequency). Implications for scale development and scoring are discussed. ({PsycInfo} Database Record (c) 2022 {APA}, all rights reserved)},
